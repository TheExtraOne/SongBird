The final task of the 1st stage of the RSS

1) Working with data, 
2) Writing a quiz algorithm (with random questions and correct scoring), 
3) Creating a custom audio player,
4) Implementing an ability to change the language of the site.

What can be improved: 
1) The player could be a class (OOP). I realized this too late, when the need to create a gallery of cards was added to the task, each of which had to have an independent player.
2) We were given data in the .js format. For me, it seems better to get a .json file from AJAX(fetch)
